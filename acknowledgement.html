               Hi researchers and visitors, my name is <strong><i>Tossaporn Surinkaew</i></strong>, and I'd like to share the story behind the creation of open-source tools for power system analysis.
            </p>

            <p>
               The journey began during my Ph.D. studies at Central Queensland University in Australia in 2019, where I became increasingly aware of the complexities arising in modern power systems. I recognized a significant gap in the analytical tools used to address these challenges. This realization motivated me to develop power system models that draw on fundamental principles of mathematices and electrical engineering. My vision was to create a software platform that evolves alongside advancements in power system technology, capable of adapting to the growing complexity of these systems. However, the demands of research and the pressure to publish at the time prevented me from fully pursuing this idea.
            </p>

            <p>
               After completing my Ph.D. in 2022 and a research fellow at Federation University, Australia, in 2023, I returned to Thailand and joined the School of International & Interdisciplinary Engineering Programs at KMITL as a lecturer. This new chapter marked the ideal opportunity to revisit my vision. Fortunately, I didn’t embark on this journey alone. With the unwavering support of my M.Eng advisor, <strong><i>Prof. Dr. Issarachai Ngamroo</i></strong>, I was finally able to turn my idea into reality. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to <strong><i>Assos. Prof. Dr. Anantawat Kunakorn</i></strong>, <strong><i>Asst. Prof. Dr. Teeraphon Phophongviwat</i></strong>, and his team for providing essential information and access to facilities. 
            </p>

            <p>
               I am also deeply thankful for the invaluable contributions of my B.Eng. students, <strong><i>Sorasak Jaingeawkum</i></strong>, and his dedicated team. Indeed, they played a pivotal role in the early stages of the project, taking the initiative to code <strong style="color: black;">PGA</strong><strong style="color: orange;">z</strong> and working closely with me on this project development.  We are currently developing the Python-based platform <strong style="color: black;">PyGA</strong><strong style="color: orange;">z</strong>,  which is expected to support co-simulation with <strong style="color: black;">PGA</strong><strong style="color: orange;">z</strong> and offer broader, more versatile access as a fully open-source solution.
            </p>

            <p>
               As we have planned, <strong style="color: black;">PGA</strong><strong style="color: orange;">z</strong> and <strong style="color: black;">PyGA</strong><strong style="color: orange;">z</strong> will be open-source platforms that integrates power systems knowledge, supports educational initiatives, and fosters collaboration with research groups to advance the analysis of modern power grids.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
               Best regards,<br><br>
               Tossaporn Surinkaew and the Team
            </p>
