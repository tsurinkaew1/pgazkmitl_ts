                Hi researchers and visitors, my name is <strong><i>Tossaporn Surinkaew</i></strong>. My journey began during my Ph.D. studies at Central Queensland University, Australia, in 2019, where I developed a deep awareness of the complexities inherent in modern power systems. At the begining, I recognized a significant gap in the analytical tools used to address these challenges. This realization motivated me to develop power system models that draw on fundamental principles of mathematices and electrical engineering. My vision was to create a software platform that evolves alongside advancements in power system technology, capable of adapting to the growing complexity of these systems. However, the demands of research and the pressure to publish at the time kept me from fully pursuing this idea—and, honestly, a bit of my own laziness too. I usually just come up with ideas and play around, but they rarely turn into anything concrete.
            </p>

            <p>
                After completing my Ph.D. in 2022 and serving as a research fellow at Federation University, Australia, in 2023, I returned to Thailand and joined the School of International & Interdisciplinary Engineering Programs at KMITL as a lecturer. This new chapter presented the perfect opportunity to revisit my vision. Fortunately, I did not embark on this journey alone. With the unwavering support of my M.Eng. advisor, <strong><i>Prof. Dr. Issarachai Ngamroo</i></strong>, I was finally able to bring my idea to fruition. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to <strong><i>Assoc. Prof. Dr. Anantawat Kunakorn</i></strong>, <strong><i>Dr. Sompob Polmail</i></strong>, <strong><i>Asst. Prof. Dr. Teeraphon Phophongviwat</i></strong>, and all faculty members of the EE Department at KMITL and their team for providing invaluable information and access to facilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am deeply grateful for the invaluable contributions of <strong><i>Sorasak Jaingeawkum</i></strong> and his dedicated team. Indeed, they played a pivotal role in the early stages of the project, taking the initiative to code <strong style="color: black;">PGA</strong><strong style="color: orange;">z</strong> and working closely with me on this project development.  We are currently developing the Python-based platform <strong style="color: black;">P</strong><strong style="color: #3776ab;">y</strong><strong style="color: black;">GA</strong><strong style="color: orange;">z</strong>. Due to limited positive response to making these tools open source, <strong style="color: black;">PGA</strong><strong style="color: orange;">z</strong> was released <strong>for educational purposes only</strong>, where basic simulation and study are sufficient. A research-oriented version with newer models and algorithms remains under active development and is shared with only our team and collaborators.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
               Best regards,
                <br> <br>
