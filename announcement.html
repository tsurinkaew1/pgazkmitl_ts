            <h3><u>Topic#2</u> <strong>An Automatic Following/Forming Framework for Inverter-Based Resources</span> </strong> (<span style="color: green;">available</span>) </h3>

            <br>
            <p>This project develops a framework that allows inverter-based resources (IBRs) to automatically switch between grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) modes based on grid conditions. First, a basic mathematical model for the control platform of IBRs (in either GFM or GFL mode) is developed through scripting. Then, the control framework is developed to dynamically adapt based on system conditions, considering the ability to form or follow the grid. The verification is comprehensively performed using small-signal stability analysis and time-domain simulations to ensure the validity of the models under various grid conditions. The verification is performed in a low-inertia/islanded microgrid with several forming units including changes in grid topology and high penetration of IBRs or other energy resources. Once completed, the models will be integrated into our open-source <a href="https://tsurinkaew1.github.io/pgazkmitl_ts"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">PGA</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: orange;">z</span></a> tool for further analysis and educational purpose. </p>

            <h3><u>Topic#4</u> <strong>Power Flow Solutions in Unbalanced Grid Conditions</span></strong> (<span style="color: green;">available</span>) </h3>

            <br>
            <p>This project addresses the development of power flow algorithms under unbalanced operating conditions, which are increasingly prevalent in modern distribution systems due to high penetration of single-phase distributed energy resources and asymmetrical loads. The mathematical framework involves solving sets of nonlinear algebraic equations derived from the unbalanced network models. The study will explore three-phase unbalanced load flow models, incorporating detailed representations of distribution transformers, voltage regulators, and line configurations. Advanced solution strategies will be proposed to enhance convergence and computational efficiency. The validated methods will be tested across various IEEE benchmarks.

<!--            <h3><u>Topic#5</u> <strong>Development and Design of a Modern Power Grid Simulator for Smartphone Applications</strong> (<span style="color: green;">available</span>) </h3>-->

<!--            <br>-->
<!--            <p>-->
<!--                With the increasing complexity of modern power systems, there is a growing need for accessible and interactive simulation tools that can bring power system analysis to the fingertips of students and engineers. This proposal aims to develop the Power Grid Simulator (PGS) for smartphones. The goal is to create a user-friendly tool that helps users understand how electricity flows in a power system. The simulator will be built using Python and related scripting, utilizing libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and PyQt for calculations, data management, and visualization. The PGS will consist of five main features: (i) power flow analysis, (ii) optimal power flow, (iii) quasi-dynamic simulation, (iv) small-signal stability analysis, and (v) time-domain simulation. The project will be developed for two platforms, i.e., iOS and Android, to ensure wide accessibility and usability. It will be continuously developed and improved to provide a more comprehensive and interactive learning experience for users. Once completed, PGS will be integrated as a new power system tool for the PSDSC laboratory (visit for more info: <a href="https://tsurinkaew1.github.io/pgazkmitl_ts/" target="_blank">https://tsurinkaew1.github.io/pgazkmitl_ts/</a>).-->

            <h3><u>Topic#5</u> <strong>Approaches to Islanding Detection and Optimal Power Flow Solutions in Modern Reconfigurable Power Systems</strong> (<span style="color: green;">available</span>) </h3>

            <br>
            <p>
                In modern power systems, the high penetration of distributed energy resources presents challenges such as unintentional islanding and unstable operation, highlighting the need for effective detection and power flow solutions. This project addresses these challenges by developing methods that enhance system flexibility while mitigating the risks associated with low stability and unexpected disconnections. The study will evaluate passive, active, and communication-based islanding detection techniques, focusing on sensitivity, reliability, and implementation complexity. In parallel, numerical and optimization-based power flow methods will be developed to manage frequent changes in system topology and loading conditions. Verification will be conducted primarily using quasi-dynamic simulation, accounting for uncertainties in the connection and disconnection of system elements. The outcomes are expected to improve both detection accuracy and the operational performance of optimal power flow solutions in dynamic scenarios. Once completed, the models will be integrated into our open-source <a href="https://tsurinkaew1.github.io/pgazkmitl_ts"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">PGA</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: orange;">z</span></a> tool for further analyses and educational purposes.

            <h3><u>Topic#6</u> <strong>Advanced Time Integration Techniques for Dynamic Simulation of Inverter-Based Power Systems</strong> (<span style="color: green;">available</span>) </h3>

            <br>
            <p>
                The use of inverter-based resources (IBRs) is rapidly increasing in modern power systems. These resources significantly alter system dynamics and introduce fast responses that are often difficult to capture. Conventional time-domain integration methods face challenges with accuracy and speed, particularly in large or stiff systems. They also struggle to represent both short-term and long-term dynamics within a single framework, which can result in missing important behaviors or producing very slow simulations. This project will develop new numerical time integration methods to address these issues. The proposed methods will improve numerical stability, accurately capture fast transients, and represent long-term system responses more effectively. The focus will be on achieving both efficiency and accuracy in large and complex networks. Performance will be evaluated against existing approaches through test cases involving fault events, system changes, and medium-to-long-term dynamic scenarios.

            <br>

            <p>This project develops advanced models for microgrid(MG)-scale electric vehicle (EV) fleets using mathematical scripting in MATLAB. The models focus on the interactions between EVs and power grids, specifically on optimal power flow and small-signal stability. They include key control functions for both EV-side and grid-side converters, allowing precise management of power exchange. The developed models will be integrated with MG-scale storage systems and/or solar photovoltaics to share their benefits with the grid. The models integrate various charging and discharging modes, such as vehicle-to-grid (known as <i>V2G</i>), vehicle-to-load (known as <i>V2L</i>), and unidirectional charging (known as <i>V1G</i>). Moreover, the grid-side converter can be modeled in either forming or following mode, depending on the grid's needs. Demand-side control strategies, such as DC bus and state-of-charge management, are also incorporated to improve grid stability and ensure reliable operation as penetration of inverter-based resource increases. Once completed, the models will be integrated into our open-source <a href="https://tsurinkaew1.github.io/pgazkmitl_ts"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">PGA</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: orange;">z</span></a> tool for further analysis and educational purpose.</p>

Then, the control framework is developed to dynamically adapt based on system conditions, considering the ability to form or follow the grid. The verification is comprehensively performed using small-signal stability analysis and time-domain simulations to ensure the validity of the models under various grid conditions. The verification is performed in a low-inertia/islanded microgrid with several forming units including changes in grid topology and high penetration of IBRs or other energy resources.
