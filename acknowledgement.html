               Hi researchers and visitors, my name is Tossaporn Surinkaew, and I'd like to share the story behind the creation of <strong style="color: black;">PGA</strong><strong style="color: orange;">z</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
               The journey began during my Ph.D. studies at Central Queensland University in Australia in 2019, where I became keenly aware of the challenges confronting modern power systems, particularly with the increasing integration of inverter-based resources. I identified a significant gap in the existing tools used to analyze these evolving systems and realized that developing my own power system models—rooted in the fundamentals of electrical engineering and incorporating advanced mathematical theories—could accelerate my research progress. This insight sparked the vision for a dynamic, continually evolving software platform that would not only integrate the latest advancements in power system technology but also adapt to the growing complexity of these systems. Unfortunately, the demands of research and the pressure to publish papers at the time hindered my ability to fully pursue this idea.
            </p>

            <p>
               After completing my Ph.D. in 2022 and a research fellow at Federation University, Australia, in 2024, I returned to Thailand and joined the School of International & Interdisciplinary Engineering Programs at KMITL as a lecturer. This new chapter marked the ideal opportunity to revisit my vision. With the unwavering support of my M.Eng advisor, Professor Issarachai Ngamroo, I was finally able to turn my idea into reality. Morevoer, I didn’t embark on this journey alone. I am deeply grateful for the invaluable contributions of my B.Eng students, Sorasak Jaingeawkum and his team. They played a pivotal role in the early stages of the project, taking the initiative to code <strong style="color: black;">PGA</strong><strong style="color: orange;">z</strong> and working closely with me on its development. Together, we are now creating an open-source, MATLAB-based platform with the potential to evolve into a powerful and versatile tool for addressing complex power system challenges.
            </p>

            <p>
               As planned, <strong style="color: black;">PGA</strong><strong style="color: orange;">z</strong> will be an open-source platform that integrates knowledge from power systems and fosters collaboration with research groups to further advance the analysis of modern power grids.
            </p>

            <p>
               Best regards,<br>
               Tossaporn Surinkaew and the Team
            </p>
